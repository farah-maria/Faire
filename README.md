# **Faire**

Faire is a full-stack web application built to manage tasks in the form of a basic to-do list. It has CRUD functionality for registered users, and a username and password ensures data privacy. The user authentication system leveraged for this purpose is the contrib module included in django.contrib.auth., as Django is the web framework I used to write the app. 

This is my first full-stack development project and I've stuck to an MVP project plan to keep the different aspects of it managable. I used an Agile orientated approach to developing the product and my kanban board can be found in my repo as an attached GitHub project called 'Faire Kanban Board'.
