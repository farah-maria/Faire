# **Faire**

Faire is a full-stack web application built to manage tasks in the form of a basic to-do list. It has CRUD functionality for registered users, and a username and password ensures data privacy. The user authentication system leveraged for this purpose is the contrib module included in django.contrib.auth., as Django is the web framework I used to write the app. 

This is my first full-stack development project and I've stuck to an MVP project plan to keep the different aspects of it managable. I used an Agile orientated approach to developing the product and my kanban board can be found in my repo as an attached GitHub project called 'Faire Kanban Board'.

The deployed site can be visited by clicking [**here**](https://faire.herokuapp.com/).

The site code can be viewed in this [**GitHub Repository**](https://https://github.com/farah-maria/Faire).

I designed the app for submission as my 'Portfolio Project 4', part of the [**Code Institute Fullstack Software Development Diploma**](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/full-stack-software-development-diploma/).
